## Customizations

### Fuzzy Finder (fzf)
Customize fzf colors and key bindings by exporting `ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES` to your `.zshrc`/`.bashrc`. See the man page (`man fzf`) for `AVAILABLE KEYS/ EVENTS` or [junegunn/fzf#environment-variables](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#environment-variables) on GitHub for more details.

- NOTE: [How to use ALT commands in a terminal on macOS?](https://superuser.com/questions/496090/how-to-use-alt-commands-in-a-terminal-on-os-x)

```zsh
# ~/.zshrc
# The following examples allow you to clear the input query with alt+c,
# jump to the first/last result with alt+u/d, refresh the preview window with alt+r
# and scroll the preview in larger steps with ctrl+w/s.
export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS="
--bind 'alt-c:clear-query'
--bind 'alt-u:first,alt-d:last'
--bind 'alt-r:refresh-preview'
--bind 'ctrl-w:preview-half-page-up,ctrl-s:preview-half-page-down'"`
```

### GitHub command line tool (gh)
In the configuration file of the `gh` tool you can set your preferred editor. This is handy when you use the interactive mode to write a comment on a notification.

```zsh
# See more details
gh config
# For example, set the editor to Visual Studio Code or Vim.
gh config set editor "code --wait"
gh config set editor vim
```
